# The CloudScape
Improvised light show using your keybaord as input. This is a predecessor to the the other light show I've made

## How to Run
**After downloading the files ensure that they all stay _within_ the main folder.** 
This is because the html file references the images locally within the folder. Then you can simply open the index.html file using your browser to run the code.

## How to Use
Each set of lights corresponds to a row on your keyboard. There are 4 sets of lights for 4 rows on your keybaord. Each row will have 4 keys on the left side and right side of the specified center key/s.
The "G" key can be used to switch between a instant and fade-out mode. Pressing the key will toggle the current lighting effect.

###### Main Row | Filled Hexes
The center of this row is the "G" key (not used as a light). The active keys include **asdf_hjkl**. Note the underscore to specify the center with a signle key center

###### Second Row | Edge Hexes
This row is right above the main row with the center key "T". Active keys: **qwer_yuio**

###### Third Row | White Bars
This row is above the second row with the center keys "5" and "6". Active keys: **345 678**. Space in the middle shows the center but with no key in between the two specified center keys.

###### Fourth Row | Spot lights
This row is at the bottom, below the main row with the center keys "V" "B". Active keys: **zxcv bnm,** . Note the Comma is an included key within the set

# Please Note!
This is unfinished, whenever I get the time I plan to add Moore featured and maybe more lights but I put it out there for those who are interested in playing with what I have so far.
